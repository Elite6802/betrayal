Caleb: Hey <br>
Ann: Hey, how's it going?<br>
<hr>
Caleb: Cool,  I noticed you went missing for a while.<br>
Ann: Yeah, life got busy, you know? I didn't mean to disappear. <br>
<hr>
Caleb: It's all good. You know, you're my bestie, and I missed our chats. <br>
Ann: Aw, that's sweet. So, what's up with you? <br>
<hr>
Caleb: Not much, just wondering if Richard is still your bestie. <br>
Ann: Richard? Yeah, we used to be really close, but we had a falling out recently. <br>
<hr>
Caleb: I see. That's tough. Why did you two drift apart? <br>
Ann: Well, it's a long story, but ever since we had a falling out, we haven't been in touch. <br>
<hr>
Caleb: I'm here for you, you know. You've got me. <br>
Ann: Thanks, I appreciate that. How have you been? <br>
<hr>
Caleb: I'm doing well, thanks for asking. What about you? <br>
Ann: I'm good too, just taking things one day at a time. <br>
<hr>
Caleb: That's the way to go. So, what's been on your mind? <br>
Ann: Actually, I wanted to talk to you about another friend of mine. <br>
<hr>
Caleb: Sure, go ahead. What happened with your friend recently? <br>
Ann: She met a guy during the holidays, and things seemed to be going well. They were getting close, but she eventually told him she had a crush on him. <br>
<hr>
Caleb: And? <br>
Ann: Well, he told her that he wasn't into love, which was embarrassing for her. <br>
<hr>
Caleb: I see. It can be tough when feelings aren't reciprocated. <br>
Ann: Yeah, exactly. She thought he was leading her on, which made it even more awkward. <br>
<hr>
Caleb: It's important for people to communicate their intentions clearly from the beginning. <br>
Ann: I agree. So, what's new with you? <br>
<hr>
Caleb: Not much, just thinking about us. <br>
Ann: Us? What do you mean? <br>
<hr>
Caleb: Well, I want to be more than friends, if you're open to it. <br>
Ann: Oh, I didn't expect that. I'll be honest; I still have feelings for you, but I'm also afraid of getting hurt. <br>
<hr>
Caleb: I understand your concerns, but I genuinely want us to be in love and make it work. <br>
Ann: I appreciate your sincerity. Let's take things slow and see where it goes. <br>
<hr>
Caleb: That sounds like a plan. I'm willing to put in the effort. <br>
Ann: Great, I'm willing to give it a shot too. <br>
<hr>
Caleb: That's all I wanted to hear. Let's focus on building something special between us. <br>
Ann: Agreed, let's see where this journey takes us. <br>

Caleb: I'm looking forward to it. <br>
